### repair efforts, and status circa 20230824

I posted to the **Issues** tab on github.com for this repo.  
I did get a response and clarified that I have verified that the exact steps of that tutorial do not work for me.  
I specified the exact changes at AWS that prevent these blog instructions from working.  
The github user I chatted with did seem to understand but are not the author of the blog and appear unable to repair. 
For sure a github account named **aws-quickstart** is surely written-to by many people. 
I believe that the blog instructions still do not work for anyone that tries.  
For me to repair is too difficult, will require much research on strange AWS security
